## Project Objective
Deep learning itself is very rewarding and it's great to accomplish training and testing a model. The issue now
is how to allow users to play with your model so they can agree that you've done well.
This is my first "full stack" ML project, incorporating Tensorflow and Tensorflow.js to create a website that 
predicts what digit you're writing in the 280x280 canvas space provided. It's a simple task but one that allows users
to play around and see what I've made.

## Project Log
You can learn more about how I created this project and what hardships I faced in my [Developer Blog](https://anishgovind.wordpress.com/2020/07/03/interactive-mnist/).

## Getting Started
1. [Click Here.](https://anishg24.github.io/InteractiveMNIST)
2. Follow instructions on the site.

Note: The model might tend to be inaccurate often times, and I will be redesigning the model architecture to get the best performance.

## To-Do
- [x] Created a frontend
- [x] Process user input in the front end
- [x] Get predictions from user input
- [ ] Prettify the site
- [x] Add a graph that shows the predictions
- [x] Improve model accuracy

## Releases
- 1.0.0 (6/28/2020): First working release.
- 1.1.0 (7/3/2020): Completely redesigned site that is more user friendly.
- 1.1.1 (7/4/2020): Fixed the user input so that the model will predict on images it's familiar with.
- 1.2.0 (7/4/2020): Added a doughnut chart that shows prediction values.
