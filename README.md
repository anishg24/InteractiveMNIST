# Interactive MNIST

This is my attempt to create a "full stack" ML project, incoporating Tensorflow and Tensorflow.js to create a website that predicts in live time what digit you're
writing in the 28x28 grid provided.

I followed [this tutorial](https://medium.com/@neuralnet.ai/tensorflow-js-building-a-drawable-handwritten-digits-classifier-d85beb858874) but rewrote
the model architecture because it was stated in the article that it wasn't accurate, so I tried to make a more accurate one.

The main frontend is provided by the tutorial, but there are obvious flaws in it that require me to try and rewrite the frontend to optimize the performance of
my model and prediction. This feature will be actively worked on while I learn JavaScript's canvas from scratch.

I am also planning to use GitHub Pages to allow a live demo for anyone, so stay attentive to when it rolls out.
